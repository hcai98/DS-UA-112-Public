    "In this homework, you will investigate restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. Here is a sample score card for a restaurant. The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. We have made these data available to you in `class_share` on JupyterHub along with the link below. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

If `data_dir/file` already and exists `force=False`, nothing is downloaded, and instead a message is printed letting you know the date of the cached file.\n",
